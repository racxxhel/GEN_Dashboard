# Read Me Before Using Dashboard 
This dashboard is designed to support the Silver Generation Ambassador (SGA) programme by visualising and tracking outreach efforts to senior residents across different areas in Singapore. Do note that the data used are randomly generated and not real. 

## Purpose

As part of community engagement and care initiatives, SGAs conduct house visits to seniors. However, understanding engagement levels, visit recency, and language needs across various blocks is crucial for more personalised and consistent engagement, 

Therefore, this dashboard is a proposed solution to identify high-need households, tailor communication by preferred language and making data-informed decisions for follow-up planning.


## Key Features
- **Filter by Language, Area, and Engagement Level**  
  Dashboard user can drill down into subgroups of households based on their needs.

- **Search by Postal Code**  
  View specific block details using postal code and get engagement summaries.

- **Bar Chart of Language Usage**  
  Understand which languages are commonly encountered in that area.

- **Tables for High-Need and All Households**  
  Identify seniors who havenâ€™t been visited in over 12 months. This is to ensure that follow-ups are done and visits are not done too far apart from each other.
